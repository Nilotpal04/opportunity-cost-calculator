# Opportunity Cost Calculator

This project explores how people make decisions by comparing trade-offs instead of chasing “best” answers.

Rather than producing a single score or recommendation, the app focuses on **opportunity cost** — what you give up when you choose one option over another.

---

## Current Features

- Select two options (Option A and Option B)
- Compare them across key dimensions:
  - Time
  - Risk
  - Long-term Payoff
  - Flexibility
- Simple decision logic based on:
  - Payoff priority
  - Risk as a tie-breaker
  - Time consideration
- Clear explanation of:
  - Which option wins
  - Why it wins

---

## Philosophy

Most decision tools try to tell you *what is better*.

This project instead asks:
- What do you gain?
- What do you sacrifice?
- What trade-offs matter **to you**?

There are no “correct” answers — only informed perspectives.

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- JavaScript
- Basic CSS

## Roadmap (Planned Improvements)

This project is intentionally built step-by-step while learning React.

Planned additions include:
- Cleaner UI and refined comparison layout
- More detailed and customizable trade-off dimensions
- Better explanation language for decisions
- Ability to reset and compare again
- AI-assisted reasoning (to challenge assumptions, not replace thinking)
- User-specific priority weighting

## Status

This project is **actively evolving**.  
Commits reflect incremental learning and experimentation.
